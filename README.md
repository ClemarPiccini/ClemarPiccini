# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.
## My name is Clemar Jr M Piccini!

I started my academic career in January 2022 at the University of Caxias do Sul, I became interested in the area of â€‹â€‹systems analysis and development after participating in online classes on the Python programming language, which I found very attractive. I worked in a company dedicated to the area of robotics and automation, where I aroused even more interest in the programming area, I started working as a storekeeper and was promoted to technical assistance assistant. I always look for knowledge in my free time through video lessons and practicing programming on my own, I have a lot of interest and admiration for the development area. Today I work as an intern in software development where I seek to improve my knowledge more and more.
