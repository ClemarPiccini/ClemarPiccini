# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.
## My name is Clemar Jr M Piccini!

I worked in a company dedicated to the area of â€‹â€‹robotics and automation, where I woke up my interest in the area of â€‹â€‹programming,
I started working as a storekeeper and was promoted to technical assistance assistant.
Today I work as a backend developer where I seek to improve my knowledge more and more.
